## Description Deliverable
### Elevator Pitch
You know that game that your grandparents had that you always hated playing because you couldn't spell to save your life? Well good news, now you'll be able to play it online. Boggle is an extremely fun yet sometimes challenging game where 16 dice consisting of different letters on each face are rolled and arranged in a 4x4 grid. The goal of the game is to create the most words with the letters you have available with the next letter in the word having to either be to the top, bottom, left, right, or diagnal from the current letter you are on. Each word length is worth a different amount of points. Points are stored in a learderboard with your name along with a personal highscore section. Scoreds are displayed to each player that is currently playing once someone finsihes a game along with their longest word. So, how many points can you get?

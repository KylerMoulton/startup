        <ul>
            <li>Words must be at least three letters in length.</li>
            <li>Each letter after the first must be a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbor of the one before it.</li>
            <li>No individual letter cube may be used more than once in a word.</li>
            <li>No capitalized or hyphenated words are allowed.</li>
            <li>Multiple forms of the same word are allowed, such as singular and plural forms and other derivations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One cube is printed with "Qu". This is because Q is nearly always followed by U in English words (see exceptions), 
            and if there were a Q in Boggle, it would be challenging to use if a U did not, by chance, appear next to it. For 
            the purposes of scoring, Qu counts as two letters; for example, squid would score two points (for a five-letter word) 
            despite being formed from a chain of only four cubes. Early versions of the game had a "Q" without the accompanying "u".</p>
